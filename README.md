## How does this work?
Follow these calculations carefully:

1. **Multiply your birth month by 5**
   - Example: November = 11, so 11 × 5 = 55

2. **Add 6 to the result**
   - Example: 55 + 6 = 61

3. **Multiply by 4**
   - Example: 61 × 4 = 244

4. **Add 9 to your result**
   - Example: 244 + 9 = 253

5. **Multiply your result by 5**
   - Example: 253 × 5 = 1265

6. **Add the day you were born**
   - Example: Born on the 29th, so 1265 + 29 = 1294

7. **Enter your final number**
   - The app will reveal your birthday!

## How the Math Works

The formula is: `((((M × 5 + 6) × 4 + 9) × 5) + D) - 165 = M × 100 + D`

- When you subtract 165 from your final number, you get a number where:
  - The first digit(s) represent your birth month
  - The last two digits represent your birth day

**Example:** 
- Final number: 1294
- 1294 - 165 = 1129
- Month: 11 (November)
- Day: 29
